# The Lost Mages

## Summary
A group of mages had there city over run by bandits. They fled into the woods where they came across a mana crystal. These crystals produce mana needed for the mages to survive. The mages decided to use the mana being generated from the crystal to build a new city and fight off enemies near by. This is a risky move as mana is a valuable target for many enemies. The player takes the role of the leader in the group. He/She them will order buildings to be built while helping the on going fights. When the player dies they would be reincarnated as a new mage in the generation after. Gaining some of the powers and status of the previous player while gaining new powers. The player must use the reincarnated mage to countine where the previous mage left off, but during that time many of the buildings would have been destroyed or turned into ruins.

## Philosophical
'The Lost Mage' is a game where the player builds their own city while battling enemies. It is a mix of a resource managment, city builder, spell casting shooter and rouge-like. The game is planned to run on any system that the technology (Unity 3D) would export to and can have a good control scheme (gamepad/ keyboard & mouse).

## Reincarnation
After the player dies the player is respawn into a new mage. This mage will have new spells/abilities. The new mage will has some status incresed base on the mage before him/her. The player will spawn in the same spot but with most of the buildings either destoryed or turned in ruins. The idea is that the player can start again but in a better starting postion than the last mage.

## Awaking (rename?)
After the first death the player gains the ability to turn into one of his past reincarnations for a limited time. During this time the player will also gain a huge staus boost, reduce spells mana cost and increase movement speed. If the player dies in this mode he/she will all reinarnation progess (Should the player just lose the reinarnation he picked or all reinarnations?). This made to feel like high risk/reward.

## Buildings

### Mana Tower
This is build on top of a Mana Crystal and will collect a small amount of mana. Mana supple is unlimited but slow to collect compare to Mana Pools. Buildings can be place around a Mana Tower. Player will start out with a free one to act as the center of there first town. When destoyed, the player will lose additional mana.

### Mana Pool
This is build on top of Liquid Mana and will collect mana. Mana supple is limited but is faster to collect than a Mana Tower. Unlike Mana Tower, Mana Pool has to be build in a building range and doesn't add to the building range. When destoyed, the player will lose additional mana.

### Wall
Blocks enemies from moving. Works well until destoryed.

### House
A place where up to 4 mages can live. The upkeep cost is based on the upkeep of all 4 mages combined. As mages level up they upkeep will cost more. A mage with no house will have a higher upkeep cost than the same mage with a house. Empty houses has a small upkeep cost.
