## Buildings

### Mana Tower
- This is build on top of a Mana Crystal and will collect a small amount of mana. Mana supple is unlimited but slow to collect. This opens up building range. Player will start out with a free one to act as the center of there first town. When all Mana Towers are destory the player loses the current life.

### Mana Pool
- This is build on top of Liquid Mana and will collect mana. Mana supple is limited but is faster to collect than Mana Tower. Unlike Mana Tower, Mana Pool has to be build in a building range and doesn't add to the building range. When destoyed, the player will lose mana.

### Wall
- Blocks enemies. Works well until destoryed.

### House
- A place where up to 4 NPCs can live. The upkeep cost is based on the level of all 4 NPCs combined. As NPCs level up they'll need more mana of the upkeep. NPCs with no house have a higher upkeep cost than the same NPC with a house. Empty houses has a small upkeep cost.

## Summary
The player is the leader in a group of mages. In a world filled of monsters, bandits and other harmful enemies. The player and the group of mages form defenses to protect themselves. After finding a huge pool of mana, the mages decided to settle there. A risky spot as mana is a valuable target for many enemies, but this spots allows the mages to use the mana to cast spells and build buildings. When the player dies they would be reincarnated as a new mage. Gaining some of the powers and status of the previous mage while gaining new powers. The player must use the reincarnated mage to countine where the previous mage left off, but during that time many of the buildings would have been destroyed or turned into ruins.
